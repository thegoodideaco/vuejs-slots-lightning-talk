# A Simple Button

Creating multiple instances of this button, the developer wants to change the
text of each button

```javascript
<template>
  <simple-button>Button 1</simple-button>
  <simple-button>Button 2</simple-button>
  <simple-button>Button 3</simple-button>
  <simple-button>Button 4</simple-button>
  <simple-button>Button 5</simple-button>
</template>
```

But the text doesn't change. `why?` because the button component doesnâ€™t provide
a slot to serve as a distribution outlet for content.

> ## To do this, we use `slots`
