# Scoped Slots

Everything works great, but now when we add slot content, we don't have access
to the current iterated item

```javascript
<simple-listbox>
  <span>Wtf is the item?</span>
</simple-listbox>
```

## Scoped slots to the rescue!

So, just like the `name` attribute we add to slots, we can also _bind_ data in
the same manner using `v-bind`

```javascript
<template>
  <ul class="list-box">
    <li v-for="(item, index) in items"
        :key="index">
      <slot v-bind="item">List Item</slot>
    </li>
  </ul>
</template>
```

When we do this, we give access to each iterated item from outside of the
component itself
