# Scoped Slots

Now that we have bound data for each iterated item, we need a way to access it

This is where `slot-scope` saves the day

```javascript
<simple-listbox>
  <span slot-scope="item">Wtf is the item?</span>
</simple-listbox>
```

The `slot-scope` attribute gives us immediate access to each iterated item

Because of this, we can design each list item outside of the `ListBox` and still
have a connection to each item

And because of this pattern, we can nest components within components as much as
we want, while still retaining scope. For example, we can add our button
component to every list item, and still be able to give the button a scope

```javascript
<simple-listbox>
  <div slot-scope="item" @click="alert(item)">
    <simple-button>Click item: {{item}}</simple-button>
  </div>
</simple-listbox>
```
