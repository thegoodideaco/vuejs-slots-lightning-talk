# Scoped Slots

These magical things give us context to the component we are applying the slot
to

Now, if you don't get what I'm saying, I didn't get it either at first. So let's
try a scenario

A developer wants to make a `ListBox` component, but still provide a default
slot to inject custom content. The component has an `items` prop, which is an
array that the component will use to populate the `ListBox` with items

```javascript
<template>
  <ul class="list-box">
    <li v-for="(item, index) in items"
        :key="index">
      <slot>List Item</slot>
    </li>
  </ul>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import Vue from 'vue'
export default Vue.extend({
  name: 'SimpleListbox',
  props: {
    items: { type: Array }
  }
})
</script>
```
