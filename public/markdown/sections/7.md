# Panel Component

Just like the issue earlier, we need to use slots to inject content

Let's provide slots for the `title`, `content area`, and `footer`

```javascript
<template>
  <div class="simple-panel">
    <div class="simple-panel__header">
      <slot name="title">Panel Title</slot>
    </div>

    <div class="simple-panel__body">
      <slot>Content goes here</slot>
    </div>

    <div class="simple-panel__footer">
      <slot name="footer">Panel Footer</slot>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Composing

This allows us to inject other components that might also have slots, such as
the button we had made!
