# Multiple Slots

Components allow for multiple slots. Each slot is specifically named.

By creating `<slot></slot>`, we are essentially creating a slot named "default".
If we create another slot and give it a name attribute, we can distribute
content in more than one place

## Example

A developer creates a panel component with a default slot

```javascript
<template>
  <div class="simple-panel">
    <div class="simple-panel__header">Panel Title</div>

    <div class="simple-panel__body">
      <slot>Content goes here</slot>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

And adds it to the page

```bash
<template>
  <simple-panel>
  Hey this is the body text
  </simple-panel>
</template>
```

But now the title needs to have a slot. And since we have already used the
default slot, we need to create another inside of SimplePanel.vue

```javascript
// put code here
```

The developer creates a named slot and inserts it within the title element

```javascript
// put code here
```
