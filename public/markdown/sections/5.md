# Multiple Slots

Components allow for multiple slots. Each slot is specifically named.

By creating `<slot></slot>`, we are essentially creating a slot named
**default**. If we create another slot and give it a name attribute, we can
distribute content in more than one place

```bash
<slot name="title" />
<slot />
<slot name="footer" />
```

In this example, we provide three separate slots within one component.

If a slot doesn't have a name provided, it becomes the default slot, just like
we did with the button
